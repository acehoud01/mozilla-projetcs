	<p>Trees are an essential part of nature, playing a crucial role in maintaining the ecological balance of our planet.<br>
		They provide us with clean air by absorbing carbon dioxide and releasing oxygen through the process of photosynthesis.
	<br>Trees also offer habitats for various wildlife species, contribute to soil health, and beautify our surroundings with their lush green foliage.
